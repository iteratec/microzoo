# microzoo

![microzoo-logo.png](./doc/images/microzoo-logo.png)

microzoo is an experimental kit for exploring and testing microservice technologies and architectures with focus on
simplicity and ease-of-use. microzoo may well serve as a tool

- to test and evaluate microservice technologies such as different frameworks and stacks
- to create a test setup for evaluation of microservice hosting environments
- for teaching and learning

microzoo consists of a library of

- a standard microservice implemented with different languages and frameworks (currently Spring Boot)
- persistence components (currently MySql, Postgres, MariaDB and MongoDB)
- microservice infrastructure components (not yet included)

All components can be configured to allow the modelling of real-world scenarios to a certain degree.

> As microzoo is work-in-progress, some features may not completely work as expected.
> All parts of the system may change over time and we are constantly adding new features. Please check back frequently. 

Available components:

- **Service implementations:** Spring Boot
- **Databases:** MySql, PostgreSql, MariaDB, MongoDB
- **Execution environments**: docker-compose, kubernetes

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Linux environment (Windows: WSL2)
- Installed git
- Installed docker and docker-compose (optional)
- Installed kubectl (optional)
- installed node/npm
- PlantUML Editor/Viewer (optional)

````bash
    git clone https://github.com/iteratec/microzoo.git
    cd processor && npm install
````

## How to use

microzoo stacks are normally specified as [PlantUml component diagrams](https://plantuml.com/en/component-diagram):

![doc/images/basic_scenario.png](doc/images/basic_scenario.png)

PlantUml uses a textual representation and can generate a UML visualization from it:

````plantuml
@startuml

database "store 1" <<database>>
note bottom of "store 1" {
    type: mysql
}

component "service 1" <<service>>
note bottom of "service 1" {
    type: spring-boot
    request-delay: 100ms
    response-delay: 20ms
}

component "service 2" <<service>>
note bottom of "service 2" {
    type: spring-boot
    response-delay: 20ms
    entity-count: 20
}

interface "port: 8080"

[service 1] -> [service 2]: HTTP/REST

[service 2] -> [store 1]: JDBC

[port: 8080] -> [service 1]: HTTP/REST

microzoo supports a subset of the features of PlantUml to describe its microservice stacks and generates
a setup for container execution/orchestration platforms (currently docker) which can be directly executed. 

The running system can be tested using [K6](https://k6.io/), observed with [portainer](https://www.portainer.io/)
or monitored with [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and [Grafana](https://grafana.com/). Integrated support for
these and other tools will be added to microzoo soon.

## Getting started

0. Install microzoo as described in section *Installation*
1. In the folder *scenarios* add a puml-file *my-architecture.puml* with your stack.
   See the [supported PlantUml syntax](doc/supported_plantuml.md).
2. Run `bin/microzoo deploy my-architecture` (use -t kubernetes to deploy via kubectl)
3. Copy *stacks/basic/tester* to *stacks/my-architecture/tester* and run `bin/microzoo test my-architecture` (Integrated support for tests will be added)

For details see [microzoo CLI](doc/microzoo_cli.md)

## How to extend

microzoo is extensible in various ways:

- add services implemented in a certain language/framework
- add persistence and other components
- add deployment support for other orchestration platforms

All components are added in the folder structure under 'components' and need a manifest named mcirozoo.yml
as minimal requirement.

See the [microzoo extension guide](doc/extension_guide.md) for details.
